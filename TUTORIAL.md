# A new convention for roman numeral analysis

A notation for roman numerals could be divided in three types of chords
- Tertian chords (e.g., `I`, `ii`, `V7`, etc.)
- Special chords (e.g., `N6 (Neapolitan 6)`, `Ger6 (german augmented sixth)`, etc.)
- Descriptive chords (e.g., `CM3D5`)

Let's start with Tertian chords.

## Tertian chords

The syntax of a tertian chord is based on **keys**, **scale degrees**, **added intervals**, **missing intervals**, and **inversions**. Other concepts like **tonicizations**, **modulations**, and **alternative notations** also exist.

### Scale degrees (or roman numerals)
- Roman numerals consist of the symbols `I-VII` and `i-vii`
- The notation for roman numerals is **case sensitive**
- A roman numeral provides two assets of information
  - The scale degree that functions as **root** of the chord, with respect to a key
  - The quality of the third accompanying that root

For example:

`I` - The root is the first degree of the establshed key, and it is accompanied by a major third

`i` - The root is the first degree of the establshed key, and it is accompanied by a minor third

It might seem weird to denote the root of the chord and (only) its third with the scale degree. 

What about the fifth of the triad?

## Behavior of the fifth

By default, the fifth of the chord is a **perfect fifth**, therefore, in major and minor triads, it is not necessary to add any additional symbol to denote the triad other than:
- The scale degree
- The case of the scale degree
